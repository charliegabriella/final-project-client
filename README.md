## User Stories

**User stories for this project:**

 - As  a  customer  I  want  to  see  max.  9  events  on  a  page  and  be  able  to  click  'next'  to  see  more  pages  of  events  if  there  are  more
- As  a  customer  I  only  want  to  see  events  that  are  not  finished  yet
-  As  a  customer  I  want  to  view  a  list  of  tickets  when  I  click  on  an  event
- As  a  customer  I  want  to  view  ticket  details  when  I  click  on  a  ticket  in  the  ticket  list
- As  a  customer  I  want  to  see  what  the  fraud-risk  is  for  a  specific  ticket
-  As  a  customer  I  want  to  be  able  to  login,  or  sign  up  if  I  don't  have  an  account  yet
